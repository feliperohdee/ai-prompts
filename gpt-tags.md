## Best Practices for Using Tags

1. **Combine Tags for Clarity**
    *   You can use multiple tags to structure your request better. For example:

        ```xml
        <context>
        Write an article on sustainable living for young adults.
        </context>

        <instructions>
        1. Start with an engaging introduction.
        2. Provide three practical tips.
        3. Conclude with a call to action.
        </instructions>

        <tone>
        Friendly and motivational.
        </tone>

        <output>
        Use bullet points for tips and ensure the introduction is one paragraph.
        </output>
        ```
2. **Be Specific and Concise**
    *   Vague requests lead to vague responses. Provide as much detail as possible without overwhelming the prompt.
3. **Iterate and Refine**
    *   Use follow-up prompts to refine the output. For example:
        *   "Can you make this more concise?"
        *   "Please add examples to the tips provided."
4. **Avoid Overloading Tags**
    *   If a request is too complex, break it into multiple interactions instead of cramming everything into one tag.
